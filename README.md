# ChatGPT-Feeder

**ChatGPT-Feeder** is a Python application built using PySide6 for selecting and processing Python project files. It features a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to browse, select, and manage Python files in a project, including options to expand/collapse the file tree and apply various operations on the selected files.

## Features

-   **File Selection**: Browse and select Python files from a project directory.
-   **Expand/Collapse**: Expand or collapse all directories in the file tree with a single click.
-   **Clipboard Integration**: Copy the contents of selected files to the clipboard.
-   **File Extension Filtering**: Lock and unlock file extensions to filter files in the tree.
-   **Persistent Selection**: Save and load file selections between sessions.
-   **Icons**: Uses a custom spoon emoji (`ðŸ¥„`) as the app icon.
